Clustered Key-Reference Frame Selection with Compact Temporal Trajectory for Talking Face Video Compression
Abstract
 we propose a generative compression framework for talking face videos. The framework incorporates a compact feature extraction network, a clustering-based key-reference frame selection algorithm, and advanced encoding schemes, enabling ultra-low transmission bandwidth with high visual fidelity. To enhance reconstruction, the framework employs a sparse-to-dense estimation strategy, generating dense motion and occlusion maps to facilitate precise motion alignment and realistic frame synthesis.
